# CrossX

CrossX is an open source cross-platform framework for building iOS, Android, Windows, UWP and MacOS apps and 2D games with .NET from a single codebase.

Fast & easy app development with focus on performance and ablility to run in two redraw modes:
* **continous** - for games,
* **smart redraw** - for apps (content is redrawn only when a change is signaled.

CrossX comes with many built in layouts and controls to build and design apps quickly from a single API. You can subclass any control to customize their behavior or define your own controls.

‚ö†Ô∏è*Framework is in early stage of development and cannot be used yet. Please come back later to check its app development readiness status.*

## MVVM Pattern
The framework is strongly based on Model-View-ViewModel pattern. No view code by default (can be realised though with specialized control subclassing) and heavy use of bindings force you to think in Model->ViewModel->View direction in every aspect.

## Skia based rendering
Rendering currently is realised with [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) which allows you to create beautiful applications.

## Other backends planned
I plan adding more backends - DirectX, OpenGL, Metal for fast rendering (skipping Skia backend totally) with possibility to access those backends native APIs.

## XX Definition Files
XX definition files are XML files used to describe views and define styles and resources. I chose a XAML-like approach but simpler in its form. The XX "language" will surely evolve into something more in the future. 

Currently XX project is put into CrossX repository and grows with the framework. 

To improve developer experience, a small tool - XxSchemaGenerator (xxsgen) was created. It generates XSD schema files based on your assemblies that use XX contracts. Thanks to that, editing views is easier with attribute names and values hints and values syntax checking.
